This is a software mirror I created for my Interactive Computing Course during Fall 2013.
 
I decided to create an experience that  could be implemented in a theme park setting. Disneyland has a plethora of different “ears” that you can purchase throughout the park, but not all of them are available at each location. The objective of this project was to make an interactive interface that could be installed throughout the park for guests to order any hat and pick it up on their way out.
